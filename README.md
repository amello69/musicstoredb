# musicstoredb
This analysis is based on the chinook database which is an SQLite database with records from a music store. 
This database was provided for a project in my data quest course. The project was also done for my course.
There are three (3) files in respository:
1. The notebook - Basics.ipynb
2. The unmodified chinook database
3. The chinook database on which changes have been made.
